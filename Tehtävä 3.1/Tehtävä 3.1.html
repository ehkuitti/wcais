            <h2>Good design and well-working implementation</h2>
            <p>Users judge a website based on how good it looks as well as how well it works according to them. Pretty design indicates trustworthiness. However, 
                a website can lose its trustworhiness by not functioning as expected or by having its critical functions not work well. Non-well functioning sites

                site because that's the limit after which your users leave.

        <h2>SEO optimization</h2>
        <p>
            Weak SEO can do harm to your website's visibility. This is because when SEO is low, the search engines of the Internet won't display it within the first search
            results of a search results page. However, there are ways to try to improve it. For example, you can add keywords to the pages of your website. This will
            tell the search engines what the page is about. After this, they can in return raise your site higher in the ranking when they how well it matches the
            desired search results of a search engine user.

                To be totally honest with you, I didn't learn much because I have some background in building websites. However, the things listed in the article
                are important to remember and rehearse when needed.

            <h2>Why do you think the article/video you selected might have been meaningful/beneficial for you?</h2>
            <p>
                Although I knew these things already, they are still very important things to keep in mind when designing websites. Because of this, it's good to have
                a look at them again once in a while to refresh your memory.
