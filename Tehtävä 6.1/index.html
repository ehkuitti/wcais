  <h2>Which are the most useful technologies to learn for a web developer and why?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>When thinking about the most useful web technologies, you have to start with the very bascis. These are HTML and CSS. Without knowing these you simply can't learn
    anything else since they build on top of these. JavaScript, for instance, is the way create functionality to your website. However, it creates the functionality by
    manipulating the document-object model (DOM) with CSS and HTML tags. This means that if you don't know those languages when you start to program in JS, there's not
    much you can do with it. </p>

        <h3>Advanced web technologies</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the needs of the fundamental 3 languages aren't enough. This is because with them you have to do everything yourself. This is where libraries, 
            frameworks and programming interfaces come to play. They all basically do the same thing which is to make the user to create more functional and prettier
            websites more easily. They offer components that do many things at once. All the developer has to do is to call them, i.e. use them in the code. These
            are for example React and Angular. They make it possible for you to create pretty interfaces just by adding elements from their collection. When you add
            them, they take care of the practical implementation of themselves, not you. This saves you, the developer, a lot of time since someone else has coded these
            ready to use "blocks" for you to just use instead of implementing the functionality yourself manually from scratch. This can mean for instance not creating
            buttons and graphical elements yourself but using the ready-made implementation provided in the library.

    <h2>Which are the best ways to learn web development?</h2>
    <p>
        The best ways to learn web development is to start with HTML. HTML is the most fundamental building block of everything web related. Thus, you should start
        from there. Once you know HTML, you should move to CSS. Don't dive into other technologies before you know and understand the fundamentals of these. Then, 
        when you feel comfortable, you should move on to JavaScript and jQuery. These will teach you website <i>programming</i>, not just <i>building</i>. At this 
        stage of your journey, you should practice <b>as much as you possibly can</b>. You can become fluent in languages only by praticing and this applies to coding
        languages too. 
    </p>
    <h2>How will AI change future web development</h2>
    <p>
        AI won't replace web developers anytime soon. This is because AI can't really operate on it's own, at least not yet. This means that even though AI can be good
        at answering your questions it doesn't necessarily know things nor how to do them. What I mean by this is the way AI works is really different from how humans
        think. What AI does when it's <i>thinking</i> is actually just adding meaning to a huge collection of data. It is really good at scraping data and finding
        similarities in it. However, it doesn't think independetly nor process information on its own. What I mean by this is it really can't do human things, like 
        finding solutions without understanding why, nor understanding progrems without being able to describe them in detail. This in essence means that it can't
        produce meaningful code without instructions. Even though it can give you working code, it can't find out independetly that the code it has produced is
        meaningful in some context. Instead, it just produces it. This is why it will not replace a good, analytical programmer a programmer knows what is needed to
        solve something and AI just knows solutions without the reason why they're needed.
